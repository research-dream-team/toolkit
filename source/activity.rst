Activity
========

This section describes the main interactive activity during the workshop, with
step-by-step instructions.


Guided break-out group discussion
---------------------------------

.. attention::

   Ask the participants to form break-out groups and work on the given
   scenario.

.. hint::
   The questions we used during the workshop to steer the discussions are
   listed below, which you might use as an inspiration in your session.

.. hint::

   Set a timer of 10 minutes for discussing each question.

Ideal world
^^^^^^^^^^^

To facilitate the discussions during the breakout session, ask the
participants to first imagine that they are in the *ideal world situation*.
They can build the ideal team they need for the task by not thinking about any
limitations (e.g. budget, etc.). The breakout groups are given two questions:

* **What are the important aspects in this project?**

  With this question, ask participants to discuss things they, as a team,
  need to manage regarding societal impact, scientific impact, open science,
  publicity, economic gains and other related aspects, and try to make the list
  as concrete as possible.

* **What skills / roles are needed to address these aspects?**

  Based on the aspects identified in the previous question, the participants
  need to make a list of relevant skills and/or roles per aspect. They are free
  to draw many-to-many connections between the aspects and the skills/roles,
  if possible.

Reality
^^^^^^^

Then invite the participants to bring the ideal situation discussed back to
the reality and asked them the following questions:

* **Do people with those skills / roles exist? Do you know where to find them?**

  The participants are encouraged to think about their own situation, e.g.
  for a certain skill/role identified, do people know if it exists in their
  institution, do people know how to approach those groups, etc.

* **Can you successfully include them in the project? How?**

  If you find the skills/roles in your institution, what are the conditions of
  including them in the research project.


Reporting
---------

After the guided break-out group discussion, ask the rapporteurs from each
group to give a brief summary of their discussion. Subsequently, briefly
reflect on how the breakout session went.


Plenary discussion
------------------

Wrap up the workshop with a plenary session focused on practical implications
of the discussion. Ask the participants to think about practical tips or
creative ideas that they can use immediately in their work.

Instead of open discussion, it is also recommended to run an online survey
(e.g. Mentimeter) at the end of the workshop, some exemplary questions could
be:

* What can you do today to address the challenges?
* What can your organisation do today?
* What is the most important take-away from the workshop for you?
* What actions can you take today that make your own work environment more
  inclusive and appreciative?
