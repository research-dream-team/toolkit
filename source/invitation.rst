Invitation to collaborate
=========================

If you decide to run a similar workshop, we would love to hear from you. We
invite you to share your own experiences and materials with the community. We
all benefit from each other's resources and experiences. Through collaboration
we can keep improving these materials.

That's why we chose to host the toolkit on GitHub to make sure that anyone can
easily build on and further develop the toolkit. You can contribute as little
or as much as you want. You can start by making a comment on the resources,
sharing your observations and experiences, improving the materials we have
already made available, adding your own materials (for example, your own
slides, new scenarios, modified agendas) or starting a discussion.
