Practicalities
==============

This chapter covers some practicalities about the organisation of this specific
workshop. Note that a general knowledge of how to run a workshop (venue
booking, organisation, announcement, registrations, feedback and evaluation
etc.) is assumed, so only topics specific to this particular workshop are
highlighted.


Duration
--------

110 min.


Audience
--------

Target audience of the workshop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given that the workshop is about the diversity of roles and contributions to
research, it is important that the audience reflects that diversity and is as
inclusive as possible. As such, it ideally includes researchers (including PhD
candidates), research team leaders, various professional support staff
(including data professionals, legal experts, ethics advisors, project
management, HR talent development etc.) and decision-makers.

Ideal composition of the organisers' team
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ideally, the team of organisers is also composed of individuals with diverse
roles and experiences, so they can relate with the audience and drive the
discussion. To the extent possible, the team of organisers should be composed
of researchers at various career levels, and have a diverse representation of
professional support staff.


Roles during the workshop
-------------------------

Apart from regular participants, to smoothly run the workshop we suggest that
the following roles are appointed:

.. _role_chairperson:

**Chairperson**

* Welcoming the participants, keeping an eye on the time and smooth progress of
  the agenda, closing the workshop.
* Most likely a member of the organisation team.

.. _role_presenter:

**Presenter**

* Person (or people) introducing the slide deck and the activity.
* Most likely a member(s) of the organisation team.

.. _role_moderator:

**Moderators**

* People facilitating the discussion within the breakout groups, ensuring
  inclusivity and respect, guiding the participants, and ensuring that
  rapporteurs are appointed (if need be).
* Can be a member(s) of the organisation team or a volunteer(s) from the
  participants.
* For an effective moderation of the breakout groups, as well as to emphasise
  the team aspect, we suggest having two workshop moderators per breakout
  group, ideally composed of an academic and a professional support staff.

.. _role_rapporteur:

**Rapporteurs**

* People who will report from the breakout group discussion in the plenary
  session.
* Ideally volunteer(s) from the participants.

Break-out Groups
----------------

.. todo::

   Introduction to the break-out groups

Participants will work in break-out groups. In advance of the workshop, decide 
how many participants you wish to have in your workshop and consequently, how 
many break-out groups you are willing to support. We recommend that the maximum 
group size doesn't exceed 8 participants per group to facilitate engaging and 
inclusive discussions.

More information about break-out discussion facilitation can be found in the 
:doc:`activity` section.


Requirements
------------

We suggest to have the following items available for the workshop:

* A large screen / projector
* Print out an :doc:`activity_sheet` for each group (ideally on a large format 
  such as A0). Alternatively you can use whiteboards or flip charts.

.. hint::
   If you don't have the opportunity to print the large activity sheets, you 
   can also use a flip chart paper. If you lay that out on the table, people 
   around it can each fill in their comments. This way the group works more 
   democratically than while using the standing flip chart.

* Marker pens for participants
* Tables set up for the breakout groups
* Timer and whistle to signal time is up (optional)
